# flask-crud

A simple CRUD-app made with Flask.

## About

The foundation for this app was implemented by following a [Flask tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1RJmh_OqeA) on freeCodeCamp.org's YouTube channel.
The remaining implementation and problem-solving were approached in a very 2023 fashion:
- A lot of questions and learning using [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com)
- Google searches leading mainly to Stack Overflow
- Various documentations

### Purpose

This app was created as a school project with an emphasis on familiarizing oneself with a previously unknown or less frequently used technology.
The goal was to create something that isn't overly complicated while expanding one's knowledge.
